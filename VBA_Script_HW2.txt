' Goal: organize a table on each sheet: Tickers, Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume
'   1. Create Headers on all sheets - DONE
'   2. Create a summary of Tickers and Total Volume for the sheet - DONE
'   3. Calculate the Yearly Change and Percent Change by defining the Opening price, Closing Price, ticker count and diff - DONE
'   4. Apply conditional formatting
